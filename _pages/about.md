I am a sophomore undergraduate student :mortar_board: in the School of Artificial Intelligence at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). Currently, I am working in the [Key Laboratory of Cooperative Intelligent Systems, Ministry of Education](https://cois.xidian.edu.cn/index.htm) led by [Prof. Maoguo Gong](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/mggong/), under the guidance of Associate Prof. [Hao Li](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/haoli/), conducting research related to adversarial attacks :mag: . This summer :palm_tree: , I will be traveling to [MVIG Lab](https://www.mvig.org/index.html) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) to work on embodied AI with researcher [Lixin Yang](https://lixiny.github.io/) and [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/index.html) :seedling: .

        <strong>Adversarial Attacks on 3D Point Cloud Recognition Models</strong><br>
        We applied the FGSM adversarial attack to the point cloud recognition model, achieving significant interference with Pointnet++ in the classification task. :airplane:

        <strong>Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Image Matching</strong><br>
        In the process of cross-modal image matching, we found that edge shape features are the most important common features of infrared and visible light modalities. Based on this, we implemented adversarial attacks in the cross-modal pedestrian re-identification task. This is the first black-box physical attack in this field. It is also the first time that generative models are used in adversarial attacks. :rocket:
